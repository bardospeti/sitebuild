                                <br> John Wiley &#38; Sons, Inc. and its subsidiary and affiliate companies (collectively, “Wiley,”
                                “we,” “us” or “our”) recognize the importance of protecting the personal information collected
                                from users in the operation of its services and taking reasonable steps to maintain the security,
                                integrity and privacy of any information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By submitting
                                your information to Wiley you consent to the practices described in this policy. If you are
                                less than 18 years of age, then you must first seek the consent of your parent or guardian
                                prior to submitting any personal information.
                                <br> This Privacy Policy describes how Wiley collects and uses the personal information you provide
                                to Wiley. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal
                                information and how you can access and update this information.
                                <h4>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h4>
                                Wiley may collect personal information from you in the following ways: (1) directly from your verbal or written input (such
                                as by consenting to receiving marketing emails); (2) automatically through Wiley’s website
                                technologies including tracking online, such as by Web cookies (which are small text files
                                created by websites that are stored on your computer), by smart devices, by combining data
                                sets, by collecting data from a browser or device for use on a different computer or device,
                                or by using algorithms to analyze a variety of data such as records of purchases, online
                                behavioral data, or location data; or (3) by closed-circuit television (if visiting our premises).
                                <h4>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE</h4>

                                In order to access certain content and to make use of additional functionality and features of Wiley’s websites and services,
                                we may ask you to register for an account by completing and submitting a registration form,

                                handled by the third party, and any personal information collected during that third-party

                                other information about your third-party account that you agree to share with us at the time
                                you give permission for your Wiley account to be linked to your third-party account.
                                <h4>INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER SOURCES</h4>
                                Wiley may receive information about you if you use any of the websites we operate or the other services we provide. We also
                                work closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners and sub-contractors

                                institutions, search information providers, and credit reference agencies) from whom Wiley
                                may receive information about you.

                                services and products we provide. Legitimate business purposes include but are not limited

                                than is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. This means that, unless information
                                must be retained for legal or archival purposes, personal information will be securely destroyed,

                                support services. In order to satisfy global reporting requirements, Wiley may be required
                                to provide your personal information to Wiley affiliates in other countries. By submitting

                                your data. Access to your personal data will be restricted to only those who need to know
                                that information and required to perform their job function. In addition, we train our employees
                                about the importance of maintaining the confidentiality and security of your information.

                                — such as your name or e-mail address — that you voluntarily disclose and that is accessible
                                to other users (e.g. on social media, forums, bulletin boards or in chat areas) could be
                                collected and disclosed by others. Wiley cannot take any responsibility for such collection

                            <p>A. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
                                provision shall be removed (or interpreted, if possible, in a manner as to be enforceable),
                                and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only

                                any terms and conditions on any of customer's documents or purchase orders.

                        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                        <h4>1. Is support required for the OpenText Fax Appliance A10x product family?</h4>
                        Yes, the first year of standard support is included in the MSLP of the system. Customers do not need to purchase a separate
                        first year support plan.
                        <br>
                        <h4>2. What does standard support include?</h4>
                        Standard support includes unlimited telephone support and online support as well as a one year hardware warranty. The hardware
                        warranty allows customers to ship, at their expense, a defective unit to an Authorized Repair Center
                        where it will be either repaired or replaced with an equivalent or better model.
                        <br>
                        <h4>3. What is the expected turnaround time for a unit to be repaired under the standard one year warranty?</h4>
                        Turnaround time is ten business days, not including shipping times. Delays involving back ordered components may extend the
                        turnaround time. Ten business days is an estimate and not a guarantee.
                        <br>
                        <h4>4. Is an Advanced Swap program available?</h4>
                        Yes. Customers who wish for the peace of mind of an enhanced support program may purchase one for an additional charge. When
                        an Appliance which is covered by an active Advanced Swap plan is replaced, a replacement unit will
                        be sent to a customer via courier, and typically will arrive the next business day. Actual shipment
                        times depend on customer location and local customs processing time.
                        <br>
                        <h4>5. If a unit is replaced, will the customer receive a new or refurbished unit?</h4>
                        If a unit cannot be repaired, OpenText reserves the right to replace the unit with a refurbished unit which has been restored
                        to factory configuration which matches a new unit.
